# Development

This document covers contributor setup and routine commands. Command definitions in [package.json](../package.json) are authoritative; update this document when their purpose or required environment changes.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js `>=22.14.0`.
- npm `>=10`.
- A supported Electron development environment for the target operating system.
- Native build prerequisites when rebuilding `better-sqlite3`, keyring packages or Electron-native modules.

Use npm only. The repository contains `package-lock.json`; do not introduce another package manager or lockfile.

## Common commands

```powershell
npm install
npm start
npm run type-check
npm run lint
npm run format
npm run check:governance
npm run change-scope -- --base origin/main --head HEAD
npm run analyze:imports
npm run verify:boundaries
npm run verify:type-boundaries
npm test
npm run test:e2e
npm run package
npm run make
```

- `npm start` starts Electron Forge with Vite in development mode.
- `npm test` runs the Vitest unit and integration suite once.
- `npm run test:e2e` runs Playwright against the Electron application.
- `npm run package` creates an unpacked application bundle.
- `npm run make` creates platform distributables and is slower and more environment-sensitive than packaging.
- `npm run change-scope` prints a versioned, read-only Git change report. Pass explicit `--base` and `--head` revisions when comparing commits; it never fetches or changes Git state.
- `npm run analyze:imports` prints the Git-tracked TypeScript/JavaScript import graph. Runtime closure ignores type-only imports.
- `npm run verify:boundaries` reports renderer, preload, shared and root-IPC boundary violations without failing the command. `npm run verify:root-ipc-boundary` enforces the clean root-router rule today; `npm run verify:boundaries:enforce` is reserved for a clean overall baseline and exits non-zero on any violation.
- `npm run verify:type-boundaries` compares production type-boundary violations with the checked-in baseline. Regenerate that baseline only as an explicit, reviewed policy update with `node scripts/verify-type-boundaries.mjs --write-baseline`.
- `npm run check:governance` runs governance contracts, harness-script tests, runtime boundaries and the type-boundary baseline gate. CI runs it before static and unit checks.

Run one unit test with:

```powershell
npm test -- src/tests/unit/example.test.ts
```

Run one E2E test with:

```powershell
npm run test:e2e -- src/tests/e2e/app.spec.ts
```

Use [testing.md](testing.md) to select checks according to the affected behavior. Do not run packaging, the complete E2E suite or every local check by reflex when a narrower test proves the changed path.

## Change workflow

1. Inspect the owning module, nearby tests and the nearest `AGENTS.md` before editing.
2. Identify whether the change crosses renderer, preload, IPC, main, server, persistence or external protocol boundaries.
3. Make the smallest complete change and preserve unrelated worktree changes.
4. Run focused evidence first, then add broader checks only for affected surfaces.
5. Report the commands actually run and any platform, credential or environment coverage that remains unverified.

## Generated and derived files

- Do not edit `src/routeTree.gen.ts` manually.
- Do not commit generated application packages, installers, coverage output or local performance recordings unless a repository workflow explicitly owns them.
- Generated assets must be recreated through the owning script and reviewed with their source inputs.

## Desktop diagnostics

Development logs from Electron main and the embedded NestJS gateway appear in the main-process console. Renderer logs and React diagnostics appear in Chromium DevTools. `Shift + Click` can jump from a rendered element to source when `code-inspector-plugin` is enabled.

Sentry is enabled only when the relevant build configuration and credentials are present. Absence of Sentry in a local build is not evidence that the instrumentation path is broken.

React Scan is opt-in and development-only. Enable it for one local Electron session with:

```powershell
$env:ANTIGRAVITY_ENABLE_REACT_SCAN = '1'
npm start
```

Vite injects the diagnostic before the renderer entry only in that mode; production builds and CI do not reference it. When enabled, the current React Scan package performs its own version check against `react-grab.com`, so do not enable it in a development environment where that outbound request is prohibited.

Performance recording and local update-feed helpers live in `scripts/` and have dedicated npm commands. Use them only when the task concerns those paths; some operations create local artifacts or require platform-specific binaries.

## Environment failures

When a required command fails because of sandbox, credential, native-module, GUI or network restrictions, preserve the original command and capture the concrete failure. Retry with the narrowest permitted environment change only after the failure identifies that boundary. Do not reinterpret a genuine test failure as an environment problem.
